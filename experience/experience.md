## Experience

### 1. Machine Learning Intern - Geocon							
- Developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable fast, AI-powered search across 2TB+ of legacy project and contract data
- Built a custom validation pipeline using the OpenAI API that checks whether contract wording matches required criteria, helping eliminate human error and manual review
- Automated the entire budget reconciliation workflow by integrating BST (Geocon’s accounting/project tracking software) with Google Sheets


### 2. Software and Machine Learning Intern - Butterflo (stealth mode startup)								
- Built a scalable real estate news aggregation system using SerpAPI, BeautifulSoup, and cron jobs to scrape, clean, and store thousands of news headlines daily into a CosmosDB NoSQL database, supporting downstream analysis and trend detection.
- Engineered a CLIP-based multimodal classification model to evaluate home images for indicators of property condition (e.g., modern vs outdated interiors) and urbanity (e.g., dense cityscape vs rural background). The model helped automatically tag listings with visual insights for investors.
- Scraped, parsed, and de-duplicated over 3,000 NARPM property managers and agents across the U.S., building a unified profile per agent with extracted metrics like portfolio size, years of experience, and regional expertise.
- Created a Python-based CLI tool that lets users enter a city and returns the top-ranked realtors based on a weighted score combining number of properties (“doors”) and experience, enabling data-backed recommendations for potential clients.


### 3. Machine Learning Intern - Fintaar AI    								
- Engineered a 91% accuracy NLP model to verify any Indian government-issued identity.
- Developed a robust anti-forgery application utilizing computer vision technologies and libraries including DocTR, TensorFlow, Keras.
- Leveraged ngrok for secure tunneling to ensure safe communication between the API and the script.
- Conducted comprehensive testing of the application by designing and implementing an API with Postman, employing advanced techniques such as pixel analysis, metadata verification, colol 
  consistency checks, steganography detection, and noise consistency evaluation.

### 4. Software Development Intern - Cumulus Systems, Hitachi
- Automated the analysis of log reports to pinpoint errors within the Measure Analyze Recommend Solve (MARS) tool, a high-performance analytics engine.
- Ensured high code sustainability and future scalability by utilizing debugging and version control tools (GIT) extensively.
