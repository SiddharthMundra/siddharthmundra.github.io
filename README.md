## **About me**
I'm an undergraduate student at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science. My experience relies in Machine Learning, Prompt Engineering, Software Engineering and App Development. I like figuring out how to save time by automating processes, and creating efficient and scalable solutions.

Currently, I am working at a geotechnical consulting firm in San Diego called Geocon. I am their lead AI/ML/Automation engineer and am currently working on building an internal chatbot GeoGPT for them.

Some of my relevant coursework includes Operating Systems, Data Center Systems, Computer Security, Cryptography, Safety in Bitcoin, Natural Language Processing, Reccomender Systems, Machine Learning in Music.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching Formula 1 and playing video games. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects—whether it’s building an app from scratch, optimizing infrastructure, or experimenting with the latest tech. You can find the source code to all my projects on my GitHub. Feel free to reach out via email if you’d like to connect!
