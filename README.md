## **About me**
I'm an undergraduate student at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Finance with a passion for Fintech and Real Estate. My experience relies in Machine Learning, Prompt Engineering, Software Engineering and App Development. I like figuring out how to save time by automating processes, and creating efficient and scalable solutions.

Currently, I’m working at a stealth-mode real estate startup, where I’m helping build machine learning models and designing data extraction pipelines through web-scraping techniques. This summer, I’ll be joining Geocon in San Diego as a full-time intern, where I’ll be developing ML models to support the company’s ongoing projects and exploring opportunities to automate manual processes

Some of my relevant coursework includes Safety in Bitcoin, Natural Language Processing, Reccomender Systems, Machine Learning in Music, Operating Systems, Design of Algorithms and Data Center Systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy watching Formula 1 and playing video games. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects—whether it’s building an app from scratch, optimizing infrastructure, or experimenting with the latest tech. You can find the source code to all my projects on my GitHub. Feel free to reach out via email if you’d like to connect!
