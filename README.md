## **About me**
I'm an undergraduate student at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Finance with a passion for Fintech and Real Estate. My experience relies in Machine Learning, Software Engineering and App Development. I like figuring out how to save time by automating processes, and creating efficient and scalable solutions.

I am currently working at a startup in the real-estate industry. I am helping them build their ML models and also am designing data extraction pipilines through web-scraping techniques. This summer, I’ll be joining Geocon in San Diego as a full-time intern, where I’ll be developing ML models to support the company’s ongoing projects and exploring opportunities to automate manual processes

Some of the relevant coursework I have taken includes Safety in Bitcoin, Natural Language Processing, Reccomender Systems, Machine Learning in Music, Operating Systems, Design of Algorithms and Data Center Systems.

In my free time, I enjoy watching Formula 1 and playing videogames. I’m always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects. Be it building a new application from scratch, optimizing existing systems, or researching about the latest advancements in technology, I’m dedicated to continuous learning and improvement. The source code to all my projects can be found on my github profile. Should you have any questions about my projects, feel free to connect with me over email anytime!
